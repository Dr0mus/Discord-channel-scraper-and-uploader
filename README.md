This script will download all the files to a newly created folder in the working directory with the name of the channel id and upload it to specified upload channel and then delete the files. All files uploaded will have their ids saved to a local db which will make sure you won't download it again. **DO NOT DO THIS WITH YOUR MAIN DISCORD ACCOUNT TOKEN**. When I was testing this programming my discord account got flagged for "suspicious activity". I was using a vpn and got my account back by changing password but, use this at your own risk.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo

2. open main.py and change **token**, **channel_id**, **upload_channel_id**

3. run, profit
